# Mathematical Implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithm using Python # 

The libraries used for the implementation are : 
- `Numpy` for manipulation  
- `Pandas` for reading data from a csv file
- `Matplotlib` for data visualization
-  `Math` for comparing the floating point values

## Data ##
 The dataset contains the details for marks achieved by the student in `Maths` and `Computer Science` subjects out of 100.
 
 ## Target ##
 - To find corelation between marks of `Maths` and `Computer Science` subjects so that we can predict the marks of any subject given marks of any one subject. 
 - To find optimal values for slope and intercept so that the cost is minimum as possible
 - To plot the optimal line on the scattered plot for visualization
